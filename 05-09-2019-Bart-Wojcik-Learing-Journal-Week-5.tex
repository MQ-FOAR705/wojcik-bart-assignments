\section{OpenREfine for Social Science Data}
\subsection{Setup}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Downloaded and extracted OpenRefie 3.2.
    \item Attempted to run software. Found that OpenRefine depends on JRE. I was a bit grumpy about having to instsall the Java Runtimes as I am not a fan of polluting my system with garbage, one-off dependencies. My experience with VirtualBox (also an Oracle product) on Windows, is that the uninstaller never completely gets rid of all the non-user facing files.
    \item Downloaded the JRE and attempted to run again.
    \item Command prompt window opened and eventually a web interface launched in my default browser. I wasn't expecting this would run like a local server with a web interface, doesn't matter.
    \item Software executed successfully.
    \item Lesson concluded.
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{Introduction}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Completed reading.
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{Working with OpenRefine}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Successfully imported. Played a bit with the preview by changing the delimiter type to see what a bad import would look like. Reverted to default CSV to proceed with work.
    \item Created the project.
    \item Used a text facet on the village column as instructed. Found the following issues when sorting: inconsistent vocabulary use between 'Chirdozo' and 'Chirodzo', 'Ruaca' and 'Ruca', 'Ruaca - Nhamuenda' and 'Ruaca-Nhamuenda'. '49' does not appear to be the right data for this field.
    \item Completed exercise, found: 19 unique results for 'interview\verb|_|date', the column appears to be formated as text, transformed to date as instructed, had a look at the available facet and chose 'Timeline' in the way of testing, arrived at a timeline graph. Found that most interview data had been collected in 11/2016.
    \item Tested clustering as instructed, found no more clustering after using 'metaphone3'
    \item Manually narrowd down to four clusters as instructed.
    \item Moving to 'Tranfsforming data'. Removed all left square brackets as instructed. Removed single quotes using same method. Removed right square brackets.
    \item Split items owned using a custom text facet, noticed several duplicate labels.
    \item 'Mobile phone' and 'radio' appear to be the two most owned items; 'car' and 'computer' the least owned. The duplicate labels need clean-up before this step, why is this missing from the worksheet?!? I thought the idea was to get the machine to do the job not have me look for repeated instances of a label.
    \item November was the month most reported for food lack.
    \item Performed \newline \verb|"value.replace("[", "").replace("]", "").replace("'", "").replace(" ", "")"| on \verb|months_no_water|, \verb|liv_owned|, \verb|res_change|, \verb|no_food_mitigation| by recycling the command using the history tab.
    \item Scoped the undo\verb|/|redo feature.
    \item Trimmed leading and trailing whitespaces and ended with only four labels as predicted by the exercise.
\end{enumerate}
