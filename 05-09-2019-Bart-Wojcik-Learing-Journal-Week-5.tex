\section{OpenREfine for Social Science Data}
\subsection{Setup}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Downloaded and extracted OpenRefie 3.2.
    \item Attempted to run software. Found that OpenRefine depends on JRE. I was a bit grumpy about having to instsall the Java Runtimes as I am not a fan of polluting my system with garbage, one-off dependencies. My experience with VirtualBox (also an Oracle product) on Windows, is that the uninstaller never completely gets rid of all the non-user facing files.
    \item Downloaded the JRE and attempted to run again.
    \item Command prompt window opened and eventually a web interface launched in my default browser. I wasn't expecting this would run like a local server with a web interface, doesn't matter.
    \item Software executed successfully.
    \item Lesson concluded.
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{Introduction}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Completed reading.
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{Working with OpenRefine}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Successfully imported. Played a bit with the preview by changing the delimiter type to see what a bad import would look like. Reverted to default CSV to proceed with work.
    \item Created the project.
    \item Used a text facet on the village column as instructed. Found the following issues when sorting: inconsistent vocabulary use between 'Chirdozo' and 'Chirodzo', 'Ruaca' and 'Ruca', 'Ruaca - Nhamuenda' and 'Ruaca-Nhamuenda'. '49' does not appear to be the right data for this field.
    \item Completed exercise, found: 19 unique results for 'interview\verb|_|date', the column appears to be formated as text, transformed to date as instructed, had a look at the available facet and chose 'Timeline' in the way of testing, arrived at a timeline graph. Found that most interview data had been collected in 11/2016.
