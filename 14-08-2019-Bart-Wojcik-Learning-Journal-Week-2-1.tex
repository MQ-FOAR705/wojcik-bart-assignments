\subsection{Getting started with Overleaf and ORCID:}
\medskip
\begin{itemize}
    \item I've attempted to sing into Overleaf using ORCID to avoid creating a new set of logins for everything that can otherwise be connected in one place.
    \item Although ORCID sign-in took me to a MQU branded login portal and allowed me to configure personal data sharing permissions, I still had finalize account creation on ORCID itself. 
    \item I thought I'd update my profile while I'm there, but I'm currently stuck on https://orcid.org/my-orcid watching two spinning arrows that clearly aren't loading the content that I requested (even though they would like me to believe that they are). 
    \item Rather than reloading the profile management page, I opted to go back to the root domain at https://orcid.org/ and click through to https://orcid.org/my-orcid, this resolved my problem). 
    \item If this is going to be my long term research profile, I may as well take the time to clone my LinkedIn details. 
\end{itemize}
